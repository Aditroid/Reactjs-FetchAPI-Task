# API Tools Hub - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

API Tools Hub is a web application that provides users with a collection of useful tools powered by external APIs. The application aims to demonstrate effective API integration, modern frontend development practices, and efficient state management.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend Framework
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience

### State Management
- **MobX**: A simple, scalable state management library
- **mobx-react-lite**: Lightweight React bindings for MobX

### HTTP Client
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests

### Styling
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code

## API Integrations

### WeatherStack API
- **Purpose**: Provides real-time weather information
- **Endpoint**: `http://api.weatherstack.com/current`
- **Authentication**: API Key
- **Data Retrieved**: Current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

### NumVerify API
- **Purpose**: Validates and provides information about phone numbers
- **Endpoint**: `http://apilayer.net/api/validate`
- **Authentication**: API Key
- **Data Retrieved**: Phone number validity, country, carrier, line type

### Fixer API
- **Purpose**: Provides currency exchange rates
- **Endpoint**: `http://data.fixer.io/api/latest`
- **Authentication**: API Key
- **Data Retrieved**: Currency exchange rates, supported currencies

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Users should be able to navigate between different tools
2. Each tool should provide a form for user input
3. Each tool should display results from the corresponding API
4. Each tool should maintain a history of recent searches
5. Error handling should be implemented for all API requests

### Weather Lookup Tool
1. Users should be able to search for weather by location
2. The tool should display current weather conditions
3. The tool should show additional weather details (humidity, wind speed, etc.)
4. The tool should maintain a history of recent searches

### Phone Verification Tool
1. Users should be able to enter a phone number for verification
2. The tool should display information about the phone number
3. The tool should indicate whether the phone number is valid
4. The tool should maintain a history of recent verifications

### Currency Converter Tool
1. Users should be able to select source and target currencies
2. Users should be able to enter an amount to convert
3. The tool should display the converted amount
4. The tool should maintain a history of recent conversions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. The application should load quickly (under 2 seconds)
2. API requests should be optimized to minimize loading times
3. The application should be responsive to user interactions

### Usability
1. The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate
2. Forms should provide clear feedback on errors
3. Results should be displayed in a clear and readable format

### Responsiveness
1. The application should work well on desktop and mobile devices
2. The layout should adapt to different screen sizes

### Scalability
1. The codebase should be structured to allow for easy addition of new tools
2. The state management system should be able to handle additional complexity

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Tools
1. Translation service using a translation API
2. Image recognition tool using a computer vision API
3. News aggregator using a news API

### User Experience Improvements
1. User accounts and saved preferences
2. Dark mode toggle
3. Customizable dashboard

### Technical Improvements
1. Offline support with service workers
2. Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Advanced data visualization for API responses

## Development Constraints

### Time Constraints
- The project was developed within a tight timeframe due to other concurrent projects
- Development prioritized core functionality over additional features

### API Limitations
- Free tier API limitations affect the functionality of some tools
- Some APIs have rate limits that could affect heavy usage

### Technical Debt
- Some components could benefit from further refactoring
- Additional test coverage would improve reliability

## Conclusion

The API Tools Hub meets its primary goal of demonstrating effective API integration and modern frontend development practices. The application provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and serves as a showcase for the developer's skills in React, MobX, and API integration.
